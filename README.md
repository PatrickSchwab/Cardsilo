# Cardsilo
Cardsilo is an app that provides a place to store all customercards. 
That way you go one further step in the direction of a digital wallet. 

You can get an overview over all your customercards in the homemenu. When cklicking on a card, you get directed to the CardView 
that gives you all information about the card in a compact form. You can also add a new card with the attributes of the Companyname the Card belongs to and some notes to go with it.
After adding the card, it automatically renders the companylogo from an API and displays it.
